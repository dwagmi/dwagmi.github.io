# LeetCode Animations 

Access at https://dwagmi.github.io/docs/leetcode/intro !

A collection of animations of solutions for LeetCode problems!

LeetCode problems are obtained from [NeetCode's version](https://neetcode.io/practice) of the infamous Blind 75 set of problems.

Animations were made using [dai-shi](https://github.com/dai-shi)'s tool based on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), called [Excalidraw Claymate](https://github.com/dai-shi/excalidraw-claymate) which makes it easy to create stop-motion animations in Excalidraw and export them to html!
